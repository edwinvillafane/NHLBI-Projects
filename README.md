# NHLBI-Projects
SAS and R Projects done as a participant of Boston University's Summer Institute in Biostatistics Training (SIBS) funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute

These projects use student appropriate data sets from the Framingham Heart Study and the Jackson Heart Study.

Each project is intended to teach the student (me) different procedures and aspects of SAS and R.

Languages used: SAS, R

Things I learned:
-How to use existing data sets and how to create my own data sets from own studies
-How to use SAS and R to interpret data by running different statistical tests including Chi Squared Tests and T tests
